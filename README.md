# Neighborhood Hotspot Prioritizer

A civic-tech web app for reporting and prioritizing neighborhood issues using spatial clustering.

## Overview
Citizens can submit geo-tagged reports (with images) and upvote existing ones. The municipality can view "hotspots" generated by clustering algorithms (KMeans or Grid) to prioritize interventions.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `docker-compose up --build`.
3. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite uses, check logs).
4. Access the backend API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## API Endpoints
- `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /auth/login`: Login and get JWT.
- `POST /reports`: Submit a report (Multipart form).
- `GET /reports/nearby`: Get reports near a location.
- `POST /reports/{id}/upvote`: Upvote a report.
- `GET /hotspots`: Get calculated hotspots.
- `GET /hotspots/export`: Export hotspots to CSV.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, Leaflet
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + PostGIS

## Testing
Run tests inside the backend container:
```bash
docker-compose exec backend pytest
```
